# machine-learning-miRNA
Machine learning algorithm(s) for miRNA-based diagnostics
This repo contains code for 2 miRNA-based diagnostic algorithms. The first is a multiple-threshold algorithm that calculates sensitivity and specificity, while the second is a machine-learning binary classification algorithm. It also contains the dataset (GSE61741table), which is in an R table format. The dataset was pulled from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 

To run this code: 
- download and install R and RStudio. 
- Launch RStudio. 
- Load the file GSE61741table into your workspace. 
- Run the programs. 
The programs are reasonably documented.
